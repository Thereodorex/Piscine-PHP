ratio : The final image ratio, meaning the ratio between the image’s width and height.
You have heard of 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ration? Well these are image ratios.
fov : The field of view of the projected image in degrees. Look for "3D field of view" on
the Internet if you want to learn more. In practice 60 degrees is a correct arbitrary
value. It roughly corresponds to the angle between your nose and both edges of the
screen of your computer right now. We will be able to modify this value if we want
to see a more or less big part of the scene.
near : The near clipping plane. This concept a little more difficult, to understand. It is
the distance of the camera from which an object is seen. Google will explain this
much better.
far : The far clipping plane. For those interested these two planes enable us to calculate
the Z-buffer of a scene, a concept outside the scope of these exercises.

’origin’: The vertex positioning the camera in the world mark. Thanks to this
vertex, we can compute a vector and then a translation matrix.
’orientation’: Rotation matrix orienting the camera in the world mark.
’width’: Width in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio. Not
compatible with the ’ratio’ key.
’height’: Height in pixel of the desired image. Is used to compute the ratio. Not
compatible with the ’ratio’ key.
’ratio’: Image’s ratio. Not compatible with the ’width’ and ’height’ keys.
’fov’ : The projected image’s field of view in in degree.
’near’ : The near clipping plane.
’far’ : The far clipping plane.
